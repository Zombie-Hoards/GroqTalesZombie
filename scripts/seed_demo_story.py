            "Satoshi Nakamoto — a name, a pseudonym, a ghost — stares at a blinking cursor. Outside, "
            "the world is unravelling. Banks that were supposed to be fortresses are crumbling. "
            "Lehman Brothers has fallen. People are lining up outside ATMs in cities they never thought "
            'would feel unsafe. The headline on the BBC reads: "The Worst Financial Crisis in 80 Years."\n\n'
            "Satoshi does not panic. Satoshi has been waiting for this moment.\n\n"
            "For years, there has been a quiet community of thinkers, hackers, and idealists who gathered "
            "in cryptography mailing lists and cypherpunk forums. They argued about something that sounded "
            "absurd at the time: what if money did not need a bank? What if strangers could transact "
            "directly — with complete certainty, with no third party deciding who deserved trust and who did not?\n\n"
            "The fundamental problem was this: how do you prevent someone from spending the same digital coin twice? "
            "In the physical world, if you hand me a twenty-dollar bill, you no longer have it. But a digital file "
            "can be copied infinitely. Without a bank keeping score — an omnipotent referee — there seemed to be no solution.\n\n"

            "It would not be announced with fanfare. There would be no press conference, no PowerPoint slide. "
            "Instead, on October 31, 2008, a nine-page PDF was quietly posted to a cryptography mailing list: "
            '"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."\n\n'

            "embedded in its raw data like a time capsule:\n\n"
            '"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."\n\n'

            "Across the world, a handful of people start running the software. Their computers begin solving "
            "mathematical puzzles. The first successful solver gets to add the next block of transactions to the chain, "
            "and for that work, they receive newly minted bitcoin. This is called mining.\n\n"

            "The logic of the blockchain is almost deceptively simple when you finally understand it. "
            "Every transaction is grouped into a block. Each block contains a cryptographic hash — "
            "a unique digital fingerprint — of the previous block. Changing any historical transaction would change its hash, "

            "The chain itself is the guarantee. The math is the referee. "
